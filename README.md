I love exploring the relationships between numbers and translating numbers and spreadsheets into stories.

My name is Radwane Lourhmati and I am super-psyched that you are reading this!

Ever since I was a little kid,software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of an computer with windows 2000 and trying to understand how this work . As I went through the BASIC of programming , it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing in these funny little symbols and commands , limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity. Throughout middle and high school, I latched on to any ideas for projects I could get, moving from "Hello World" all the way to other projects . I learned java , then python , tearing through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development. I was insatiable.

This passion carried me through my education at Preparatory classes and the national institute of post and telecommunications . Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.

So, now, in industry, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
